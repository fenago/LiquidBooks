# The Diary of David Chen: A Problem Aware Attorney's Journey

## Entry 1: Before Using the Product
**March 15th, 11:47 PM**

The house is finally quiet. Sarah and the kids are asleep, but here I am again, staring at the ceiling like it holds the answers to my problems. The red numbers on the clock mock me—11:47 PM—and my mind is still racing like a hamster on a wheel that never stops spinning.

Today was another one of *those* days. I swear the phone has become my enemy. It sits there on my desk like a black plastic vulture, waiting to swoop down and devour whatever focus I manage to scrape together. This morning I was deep in the Morrison brief—you know, the one that could make or break our reputation with the insurance company—when RING. Some guy wanting to know if we handle slip-and-fall cases. Twenty minutes of my life I'll never get back, explaining why his case isn't worth pursuing, while the Morrison deadline loomed like a storm cloud.

Then RING again. A woman whose ex-husband violated their custody agreement. Legitimate case, but she wanted to negotiate our fees for thirty minutes. RING. A telemarketer selling legal software. RING. Mrs. Patterson calling about her will for the third time this week, asking the same questions I answered on Monday.

By lunch, I had answered the phone seventeen times. Seventeen interruptions. Seventeen fractures in my concentration. I know because I started keeping a tally on a sticky note, watching the little marks pile up like prison bars.

The anxiety sits in my chest like a clenched fist. Every time the phone rings, my shoulders tense up like I'm bracing for impact. My jaw aches from grinding my teeth. Sarah noticed it again at dinner—asked if I was okay while I pushed my food around my plate, my mind still churning through the day's chaos.

I missed Emma's soccer practice again. Promised her I'd be there, but got trapped on a call with a potential client who ultimately decided to "think about it." The disappointment in her eight-year-old eyes cuts deeper than any opposing counsel's cross-examination ever could.

The worst part? I know I'm drowning in my own success. The phone rings because people need help, because we're building something here. But I feel like I'm trying to catch water with my bare hands. Every call could be the next big case, but most of them are just... noise. Static. Time thieves dressed up as opportunities.

I lie here calculating billable hours like rosary beads. Six hours of actual legal work today. Six. Out of twelve hours at the office. The other six hours evaporated into phone calls, administrative quicksand, and the constant mental gear-shifting that leaves me feeling like my brain has been put through a blender.

Tomorrow I have to finish the Morrison brief, prepare for the Henderson deposition, and somehow find time to review the partnership agreement for the new client. But I know—I KNOW—the phone will ring, and I'll answer it because what if it's THE call? What if it's the case that changes everything?

The fist in my chest tightens. I can hear my heartbeat in my ears. This can't be sustainable. There has to be a better way. There HAS to be.

But what if there isn't?

## Entry 2: During Their First Use of Product
**April 3rd, 2:15 PM**

Something strange happened today. Something so unusual that I had to stop what I was doing and just... sit with it for a moment.

Silence.

Not the dead silence of an empty office, but the golden silence of uninterrupted focus. For the first time in months—maybe years—I worked on the Hartwell contract for two straight hours without a single phone interruption. Two hours. It felt like discovering a hidden room in my own house.

The AI receptionist went live this morning. I'll admit, I was skeptical as hell. Another tech solution promising the moon and delivering a handful of dust. But Mike from the bar association swore by it, and desperation makes you try things you normally wouldn't.

The first call came in around 9:30 AM. I braced myself, shoulders already climbing toward my ears, hand reaching for the phone out of pure muscle memory. But then... nothing. The phone didn't ring on my desk. Instead, I heard this professional, warm voice through the office speakers—not robotic, not obviously artificial—greeting the caller like a real receptionist would.

"Good morning, thank you for calling Chen & Associates. How may I help you today?"

I found myself leaning forward, listening like I was eavesdropping on my own business. The caller was asking about personal injury cases. The AI—I still can't believe I'm writing this—actually knew our practice areas, our fee structure, even asked qualifying questions I would have asked. It scheduled a consultation for Thursday and sent the caller our intake forms automatically.

The whole interaction took maybe five minutes. Five minutes where I kept working. Five minutes where my concentration stayed intact, like a soap bubble that didn't burst.

But here's the thing that's messing with my head: I felt guilty. Guilty for not answering the phone myself. What if the AI missed something important? What if the caller could tell it wasn't human? What if they hung up and called our competitors instead?

The anxiety is still there, but it's... different now. Instead of the sharp, immediate panic of a ringing phone, it's more like a low-grade worry humming in the background. Like waiting for the other shoe to drop.

Three more calls came in before lunch. A debt collection case (qualified and scheduled), someone looking for a criminal defense attorney (politely redirected to a colleague), and a telemarketer (efficiently dismissed). Each time, I caught myself holding my breath, waiting for the system to fail, for the caller to demand to speak to a "real person."

But they didn't.

The strangest part? Around 1 PM, I realized I had been working for three and a half hours straight. My coffee had gone cold. My neck was stiff from hunching over documents. But my mind felt... clear. Sharp. Like someone had wiped the fog off my mental windshield.

I actually finished the Hartwell contract. Finished it. Not just pushed it along or made progress—completed it. Sent it off to the client with time to spare before my 3 PM appointment.

When was the last time I finished something ahead of schedule?

I'm cautiously optimistic, but I'm also terrified to hope. What if this is just beginner's luck? What if tomorrow the system crashes, or the AI starts giving wrong information, or clients start complaining?

But right now, in this moment, sitting here with a completed contract and a clear desk, I feel something I haven't felt in months:

Control.

Just a taste of it, but it's there. Like finding a twenty-dollar bill in an old jacket pocket.

Maybe—just maybe—there is a better way.

## Entry 3: After Using The Product
**May 18th, 8:30 PM**

I'm home. Actually home. Not physically-present-but-mentally-still-at-the-office home, but genuinely, completely home. Emma's homework is done, Tommy's in bed with a story, and Sarah and I just finished watching a movie together. A whole movie. Without me checking my phone once.

Six weeks. It's been six weeks since the AI receptionist became part of our team, and I barely recognize my own life.

The numbers tell part of the story: my billable hours are up 23% this month. Twenty-three percent. That's not just efficiency—that's transformation. But the numbers don't capture the real change, the one that's harder to quantify but impossible to ignore.

The fist in my chest is gone.

I didn't even realize it was missing until yesterday when a potential client called during my lunch break. My old self would have tensed up, interrupted my sandwich, and spent twenty minutes on the phone. Instead, I heard the AI handling the call through the office speakers, qualifying the lead, scheduling a consultation, and sending our information packet. I kept eating my sandwich. I actually tasted it.

The anxiety that used to follow me home like a stray dog has... not disappeared, but transformed into something manageable. Instead of the constant, gnawing worry about missed calls and lost opportunities, I have data. Real information. The AI sends me a summary every evening: calls received, leads qualified, appointments scheduled, time saved.

Time saved. Those two words have become my favorite phrase in the English language.

This morning I had a revelation that stopped me in my tracks. I was reviewing the Patterson estate documents—you remember Mrs. Patterson, the one who used to call three times a week with the same questions—when I realized something profound: I was enjoying the work. Actually enjoying it. The legal analysis, the problem-solving, the careful crafting of language that protects my client's interests. When did I stop enjoying the practice of law? When did it become just a series of interruptions punctuated by brief moments of actual legal work?

The AI doesn't just answer phones—it gives me back my professional identity. I'm a lawyer again, not a glorified receptionist who occasionally practices law between phone calls.

Sarah noticed the change before I did. Last week she said I seemed "lighter." Not physically—though I have been sleeping better—but emotionally. The constant tension that had become my default state has melted away like ice in spring.

I took Emma to her soccer practice on Tuesday. Not only did I take her, but I stayed and watched the whole thing. Really watched, not just stood there while my mind churned through case files and phone calls. When she scored her first goal of the season, I was present for it. Completely, utterly present.

The fear is still there sometimes—the old worry that I'm missing something important, that the AI will make a mistake, that clients will figure out they're not talking to a human. But those fears are getting smaller, crowded out by evidence. Evidence that the system works. Evidence that clients are happy. Evidence that I can trust this technology to be the gatekeeper I never knew I desperately needed.

Last Friday, I did something I haven't done in three years: I left the office at 5 PM on a Friday and didn't think about work until Monday morning. The AI handled the after-hours calls, scheduled weekend consultations for Monday, and sent me a summary Sunday evening. I spent Saturday at the park with my family, Sunday reading a book that had nothing to do with law, and Monday morning I walked into the office refreshed instead of already exhausted.

The Morrison case—the one that was keeping me up at night back in March—we won it. Not just won it, but delivered a result that exceeded the client's expectations. The insurance company was so impressed they've referred two more cases to us. Cases I can actually focus on because I'm not constantly interrupted by the phone.

I've started dreaming again. Not the stress dreams about missed deadlines and angry clients, but actual dreams about the future. About growing the firm. About taking on more complex cases. About maybe, someday, taking that vacation Sarah and I have been talking about for five years.

The AI receptionist didn't just solve my phone problem—it gave me back my life. It gave me back my marriage, my relationship with my kids, my love for the law, and most importantly, it gave me back myself.

Tomorrow I'm meeting with two other small firm owners who want to know about our "secret weapon." I'm going to tell them the truth: it's not magic, it's not a miracle cure, but it is the closest thing to a professional lifeline I've ever experienced.

For the first time in years, I'm excited about tomorrow instead of dreading it.

The fist in my chest has been replaced by something I'd almost forgotten existed: hope.
